    "Querying consists of three distinct stages:\n",
    "- Retrieval is when you find and return the most relevant documents for your query from your Index. As previously discussed in indexing, the most common type of retrieval is \"top-k\" semantic retrieval, but there are many other retrieval strategies.\n",
    "- Postprocessing is when the Nodes retrieved are optionally reranked, transformed, or filtered, for instance by requiring that they have specific metadata such as keywords attached.\n",
    "- Response synthesis is when your query, your most-relevant data and your prompt are combined and sent to your LLM to return a response."
